# datoms-differ

Find the diff between two txes in datoms.

*What the what?*

Yeah, good question. Ahem. Basically, it's a way of keeping track of changes in
data via a datomic/datascript-like API and data structure.

*What's it for then?*

This is a tool to use when you want to keep clients in sync with a backend. The
client is initialized with a datascript db when connecting, and is fed updates
in the form of tx-data when the backend changes.

*So what does this do again?*

You write transactions to assert information about entities from a blank slate.
Then datoms-differ finds out what's changed since the last time. It's a differ
that takes the old data plus a datascript-like transaction of entity maps, and
outputs a set of tx-data additions and retractions.

*What the what?*

Yeah, still a good question.

## Install

Add `[datoms-differ "0.4.1"]` to `:dependencies` in your `project.clj`.

## API

Require `[datoms-differ.core]`.

### `(create-conn schema)`

Takes a datascript schema and creates a "connection" (really, an atom with an
empty db). A datascript schema might look like this:

```
(def schema
  {:route/number {:db/unique :db.unique/identity}
   :route/vessels {:db/valueType :db.type/ref
                   :db/cardinality :db.cardinality/many}
   :vessel/imo {:db/unique :db.unique/identity}})
```

Like datascript, datoms-differ only cares about `:db.unique/identity`,
`:db.type/ref`, `:db.cardinality/many` and `:db/isComponent`.

### `(transact! conn source entity-maps)`

Takes a connection, a keyword source identifier and a list of entity maps, and
transacts them into the connection.

- `conn` - the atom you created with `create-conn`
- `source` - you can put data into the connection from multiple sources, but
  since datoms-differ will retract missing values, it will only retract values
  previously asserted by the same source.
- `entity-maps` - a list of entity maps that are asserted by this source. Example:

```
[{:route/number "100"
  :route/name "Stavanger-Tau"
  :route/vessels [{:vessel/imo "123"
                   :vessel/mmsi "456}]}
 {:vessel/imo "123"
  :vessel/name "MF Hardanger"}]
```

Note that every entity map needs to contain one and only one attribute that is
marked as `:db.unique/identity` in the schema. Alternatively, you may use `:db/id` to identify the entity instead.

Another interesting note about the above example is that since `:route/vessels`
is marked as `:db.type/ref`, and `:vessel/imo` is `:db.unique/identity`, there
will only be two entities as a result of this transaction. The route and one
vessel with all three asserted attributes (imo, mmsi and name).

The returned value from `transact!` has `:db-after`, `:db-before`, but most
interestingly it has a `:tx-data` list of datoms. **This is the diff! Here it
is!**

## Exporting to datascript

There's also some tools for exporting to datascript. This lets you create a
datascript db in the client, and then keep it up to date with new txes.

Use `[datoms-differ.export]` with `(export-db db)` that gives you a string that
can be read by clojurescript (when datascript is loaded) to create a datascript
db.

If you want to reduce the amount of bytes sent over the wire, you can also use
`(prune-diffs schema tx-data)` to remove retractions of values that are later
asserted. This optimalisation is possible since datascript doesn't have a notion
of history.

## Partial updates

Datoms differ retracts facts that are not restated in new transactions. If you
want to update some information without having to rebuild everything, you can
add `:partial-update? true` meta to the list of entity maps.

```
(dd/transact! conn :my-source
              (with-meta
                [{:vessel/imo "123"
                  :vessel/name "Updated name"}]
                {:partial-update? true}))
```

You should probably avoid this feature.

## Contribute

Yes, please do. And add tests for your feature or fix, or I'll
certainly break it later.

#### Running the tests

`lein test` will run all tests.

`lein test-refresh` will run all the tests indefinitely. It sets up a
watcher on the code files. If they change, only the relevant tests will be
run again.
